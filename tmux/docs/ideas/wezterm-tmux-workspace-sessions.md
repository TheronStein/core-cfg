# CORE Environment

# Global Scope Tools

Tools necessary for interacting with the developement enviorment

## Planned Implementations/Features

Contextual Userspaces serving as top level identifier for serving user preferences, customizations and tools per space definition.

# UserSpaces / Contextual Domains and Scopes

A workspace category, representing a collection of projects and a scope specification of relevant tools

## Userspace Context

Different types of project and work require different tools to accomplish tasks, we can typically group together similar tasks that require similar tools to keep ourselves organized and focused.

Examples:

```
Financial
Development
School
Work
```

I find myself creating scratch notes of how much things willl cost, looking at calendars to think how much money i'll have at a given time given the bill dates i have setup on my calendar. These tools are always useful with this type of associated task, so the idea is we can create a global defined scope that populates all of the UI menus with those tools.

Ex...

- Calendar UI
- Calculator UI
- Task Manager UI
