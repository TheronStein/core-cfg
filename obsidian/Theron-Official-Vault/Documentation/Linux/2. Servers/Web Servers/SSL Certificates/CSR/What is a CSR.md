A CSR code ([Certificate Signing Request](https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/337/2290/what-is-a-certificate-signing-request-csr/)) is a specific code and an essential part of the SSL activation process. It contains information about the website name and the company contact details. For many reasons, the code should be created on the hosting server end. For some servers, it is the obligatory condition.

  

_**Note**: Many hosting providers offer CSR code generation assistance to their clients where possible. Thus, it is worth checking with the web-hosting company whether they provide such a service and whether it is available in your hosting plan._
