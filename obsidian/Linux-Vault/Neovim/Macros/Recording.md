## Recording

To start recording a macro, press:

```
q{register}
```

where `{register}` is any letter (e.g., `a`).

For example, to record a macro in register `a`:

```
qa
```

Now, Vim is recording everything you type.

When you're done, press:

```
q
```

This stops the recording and saves the macro in register `a`.
