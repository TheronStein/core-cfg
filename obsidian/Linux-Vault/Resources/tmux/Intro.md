## What is tmux?
`tmux` is a terminal multiplexer that allows you to manage multiple terminal sessions from a single window. It's useful for running more than one command-line program at the same time within the same terminal, or for keeping programs running after you've disconnected from a server.

## Why use tmux?
- **Persistent Sessions:** Programs running in a `tmux` session continue to run in the background even when you disconnect.
- **Multiple Windows:** You can have multiple windows open within each session.
- **Split Views:** You can split each window into multiple panes.
- **Customizable:** `tmux` is highly customizable, allowing you to change keyboard shortcuts, automate tasks, and alter the appearance.
