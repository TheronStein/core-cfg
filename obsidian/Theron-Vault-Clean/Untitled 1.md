give me the full code for the color picker being integrated in properly with the terminal configuration, updating from a file containing all_theme references like it was in the code provided to you and used to dynamically update the color scheme dynamically. This can easily be done and it's all provided there for you, i ran the color browser on a wezterm terminal loading its own config file and it was doing all the things we needed to finally get it working, it wasnt taking in the the global theme, it had its own independent rules of color theming so it wouldn't conflict. I just need you to help me integrate the complexity of what we had together with what i have found. If you can have wezterm select a session at the start or make a new one, then once providing that selection, starting an entirely new terminal process using wezterm-gui --config-file="/sessions/session_name.lua" and have it attached to the previously defined choice, then integrate the color browser to hook into the terminal with the active $TMUX_SESSION, it solves everything
