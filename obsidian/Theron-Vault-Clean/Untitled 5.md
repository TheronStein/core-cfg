Configuration Optimization & Specification WorkflowAudit Existing SettingsGather your current tmux.conf (and related plugin configs) into one place.Identify sections, binds, and options that are in use versus unused or duplicated.Prioritize Core ImprovementsStart by optimizing global options (prefix key, history limit, mouse support).Ensure these foundational settings are tuned before tweaking plugin behavior.Review Plugin BlocksLocate each @plugin declaration (e.g. TPM lines) and confirm whether its config stanza is present.Flag any plugins without accompanying settings or binds.Request Missing SpecificationsFor each unconfigured plugin, prepare a brief questionnaire:“Which keybindings do you expect for Plugin X?”“What status-bar elements should Plugin Y display?”“Do you need custom scripts or hooks tied to Plugin Z?”Consolidate & SimplifyMerge overlapping binds or redundant options into single, clear definitions.Remove or comment out legacy entries that no longer apply.Optimize Plugin SettingsFor each plugin, apply best-practice defaults (e.g., vi-mode copy, session-picker shortcuts).Group plugin configs in their own section, with a header comment.Validate InteractionsCheck that plugin binds don’t conflict with core or other plugin keybindings.Run tmux source-file ~/.tmux.conf and manually test critical workflows.Iterate with FeedbackShare the optimized config outline and ask, “Does this cover your desired behavior for Plugin X?”Incorporate any additional preferences or edge-case requirements.Document Changes InlineAnnotate each change with a one-line comment explaining its purpose or origin.Link back to your questions/answers for future reference.Finalize & VersionTag the updated config with a new version/comment banner.Commit to source control and note any unresolved plugin specs as TODOs
