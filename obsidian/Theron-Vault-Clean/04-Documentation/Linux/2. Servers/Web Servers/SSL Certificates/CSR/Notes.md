If you do not see your server type listed above, click on [this link](https://sectigo.com/knowledge-base/product/Certificate_Signing_Request_CSR) for **tips to generate CSR** provided by the Sectigo Certificate Authority (CA).  
 

Alternatively, the following online tool can be used to generate CSR: [https://decoder.link/csr_generator](https://decoder.link/csr_generator). You will find the instructions on how to use it in [this article](https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/9875/2287/easywp-how-to-generate-a-csr/). Please make sure to save both the CSR and Private Key codes, as the latter one will be required for the certificate installation process on the server.

If you are activating a Multi-Domain certificate, and your server does not allow you to generate a CSR for multiple common names, activate your certificate using just one common name. You will be able to add all the required Subject Alternative Names (SANs) through your Namecheap account during the activation process.

_**Please note:** Normally, a dedicated IP address is required for [SSL installation](https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/795/14/how-to-install-ssl-certificates/). However, you may install your SSL certificate on a shared IP address using the Server Name Indication (SNI) protocol extension available in your cPanel. You can learn more about the differences between a dedicated IP and SNI technology in the [SNI Technology guide](https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/9259/33/sni-technology/). When contacting our support team regarding this issue, please specify whether you wish to order a dedicated IP address or have your SSL installed on a server with a shared IP._
