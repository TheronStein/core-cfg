To embed a PDF:

```md
![[Document.pdf]]
```

You can also open a specific page in the PDF, by adding `#page=N` to the link destination, where `N` is the number of the page:

```md
![[Document.pdf#page=3]]
```

You can also specify the height in pixels for the embedded PDF viewer, by adding `#height=[number]` to the link. For example:

```md
![[Document.pdf#height=400]]
```
