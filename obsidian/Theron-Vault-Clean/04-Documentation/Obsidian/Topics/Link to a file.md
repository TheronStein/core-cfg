To create a link while in Editing view, use either of the following ways:

- Type `[[` in the editor and then select the file you want to create a link to.
- Select text in the editor and then type `[[`.
- Open the [Command palette](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Command+palette) and then select **Add internal link**.

While you can link to any of the [Accepted file formats](https://help.obsidian.md/Files+and+folders/Accepted+file+formats), links to file formats other than Markdown needs to include a file extension, such as `[[Figure 1.png]]`.

Autocomplete functionality switches to a simpler result algorithm when the vault reaches 10,000 items to maintain optimal application performance.
