To embed an image:

```md
![[Engelbart.jpg]]
```

![Engelbart.jpg > outline](https://publish-01.obsidian.md/access/f786db9fac45774fa4f0d8112e232d67/Attachments/Engelbart.jpg)

You can change the image dimensions, by adding `|640x480` to the link destination, where 640 is the width and 480 is the height.

```md
![[Engelbart.jpg|100x145]]
```

If you only specify the width, the image scales according to its original aspect ratio. For example, `![[Engelbart.jpg|100]]`.

You can also embed an externally hosted image by using a markdown link. You can control the width and height the same way as a wikilink.

```md
![250](https://publish-01.obsidian.md/access/f786db9fac45774fa4f0d8112e232d67/Attachments/Engelbart.jpg)
```
