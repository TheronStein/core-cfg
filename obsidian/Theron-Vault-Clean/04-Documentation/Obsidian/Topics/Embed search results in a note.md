To embed search results in a note, add a `query` code block:

````
```query
embed OR search
```
````

[Obsidian Publish](https://help.obsidian.md/Obsidian+Publish/Introduction+to+Obsidian+Publish) doesn't support embedded [search results](https://help.obsidian.md/Obsidian+Publish/Publish+limitations#Search). To see a live rendered example, use the code block above within your vault.
