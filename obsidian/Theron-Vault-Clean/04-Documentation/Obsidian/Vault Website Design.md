[Obsidian Publish](https://obsidian.md/publish) is a cloud-based hosting service that lets you publish your notes as a wiki, knowledge base, documentation, or digital garden.

Select the notes you want to share with the world, press **Publish**, and we'll host it at `publish.obsidian.md/your-site`

If you're reading this on [help.obsidian.md](https://help.obsidian.md), you're already looking at a site that uses Obsidian Publish! You can see the vault on [GitHub](https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-docs).

Many of the [CSS variables](https://docs.obsidian.md/Reference/CSS+variables/CSS+variables) utilised in the Obsidian app can also be employed in Obsidian Publish (Publish), with corresponding selectors. However, to address to the differing requirements of Publish, the variables in this section were specifically created for Publish, and are to be inserted within the `.published-container` selector.

See [Build a Publish theme](https://docs.obsidian.md/Themes/Obsidian+Publish+themes/Build+a+Publish+theme) for more details.
