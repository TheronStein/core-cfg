[`Scope`](03%20Documentation/TypeScript%20API/Scope.md)

## Scope class

A scope receives keyboard events and binds callbacks to given hotkeys. Only one scope is active at a time, but scopes may define parent scopes (in the constructor) and inherit their hotkeys.

**Signature:**

```typescript
export class Scope 
```
