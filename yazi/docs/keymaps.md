i press w so much inattentively for navigation, i'd rather just leave it alone. 

for the yazi layout keymaps, just do n instead of w, 

can i use f1-f12 keys?

I think i'd rather all of my jump keys be bound to g, regardless of context, i dont need hard coded directories bound to g when i have the bookmarks, and even then i can find another way if i really want to have directories bound like that.

remove these

Go to mount home

Go to ~/.ssh/

Go to ~/Downloads

Go to ~/.config

Go home (~)

move Go to git root in with the git group of actions.

move the jumping commands in with g, regardless of context.

put linemode all back to , move sort keymaps to the t group and toggle keymaps to the T group 

toggle keymaps can go into u for ui, integrate toggle pane and auto layout in with it.

 

remap Spot/preview file off tab into =

tab key group:

tab + space new tab (current dir)

tab + c  new tab (Home)

tab + m merge current tab

tab + enter merge all tabs

add these in with rsync/rclone key maps

Mount & jump to remote
