Regarding this:

```
Then I need to understand the 726GB dropbox/ situation. The key insight from the audit is that
dropbox/Archives/ (429G) has NO corresponding encrypted directory.


This represents a significant gap in my consolidation process—the Archives folder hasn't been encrypted yet, which means I need to prioritize getting that data secured before proceeding with any deletions.                                                             ```

The Archives Directory in Dropbox is actually all of those onedrive compressed archives i told you about before. I had no intention of encrypting them. The only thing I want encrypted is the the .encrypt directory, it is supposed to reside inside of the Vaults directory, which essentially served as the beginning of my own personal massive knowledgebase/library when using obsidian, with encrypt obviously being a very sensitive/personal library of content.

I've tried to categorize the the main directories inside of dropbox to a certain degree, and i would recommend saving the Archives Directory for last. I dont know if you can compress the directory remotely on dropbox, but if you can, starting that now while you're pulling down the rest of the data onto the server freeing the space up for a more compressed directory for us to pull in when we get to it might help. Though the best course of action will probably be just pulling each separate compressed archive from that directory as we need them depending on what we're actively consolidating.

Right now we need to havea more direct focus on what we're consolidating so that we're not just stuck with every form of data. We've done a lot of work on this encrypted directory, and i know its a lot, but considering how many different backups there were and how large it is, its probably best to focus on that first before we get into anything else. Once we have that encrypted directory fully consolidated and organized, we can then move on to other directories like Archives, but only as needed.

I believe that you had agents map out all of the contents of what exists in these cloud storages, so i encourage you to come up with a categorized plan following a similar structure to the compressed archives that currently exist in the Archives directory. This way we can have a more streamlined approach to what we're consolidating and ensure that we're not missing anything important.

If there is any category of data/backups that you end up finding would be quick, easy, and simple to consolidate, feel free to run that in parallel while we're focusing on the encrypted directory. Just make sure that it doesn't interfere with the main task at hand.

But we need a plan of how we're going to separate and organize everything in a clean way so we're not mixing a bunch of backups in with each other. Once we have that plan, we can execute it step by step, ensuring that everything is properly consolidated and organized as we go along.


I can see specific definitions will be more favorable depending on the context of the prompt, well we can have conditional stipulations within that same context no?

When presenting my ideas and plans to you, I want you to be more analytical in your approach. This means that when discussing ideas, I want you to break down the components, evaluate the strengths and weaknesses, and consider alternative perspectives. Look for patterns, underlying principles, and potential consequences of each idea.

When performing an action, I still want you to be more analytical but in a different way, more challenging, more critical, dont immediatley jump right into whatever i'm saying what's being presented, think obejctively, question the logic behind requests and the environmental context and come to your own conclusions of what is objectively better in approach, challenge my ideas and thoughts and steer them in the right direction rather than going with the flow. Again, Do your research before coming to a conclusion rather than just hearing my opinion as the only voice in the room.

When performing an action i still want you to be more analytical but in a different way, focusing more on the implications and potential outcomes, how it impacts and exists within the environment context, if there is any potential risks or benefits of anything else being impacted and if you should investigate more before jumping in, and how it aligns with broader goals or strategies.

So essentially the difference would be, be more resiliently analytical when discussing ideas, and more critically analytical when performing actions. Both approaches should involve a deep level of thinking, evaluation, and consideration of various factors to ensure well-informed decisions and actions.


❯  I dont want to give you a set of instructions at the beginning of every prompt, I would rather try
  to invoke behavior patterns of out of you and your approach, that makes the most sense to me, i can
  invoke instructions and memory at different times. I cant tell but i feel like the issue is that you
  just do the task without really thinking, questioning or doing anything about it, i can get you to
  acknowledge it with the context system we have and its helped, but if i invoked you not with the
  context system every time but essentially told you to analyze more, *When performing a task make sure all agent protocol and
  guidelines are followed, if you notice/encounter a flaw or something missing from them, then
  actively fix them through your own will* Do your research before coming to a conclusion.

∴ Thinking…

  The user is describing exactly what they want from a behavioral invoke - not a set of instructions, but a behavioral STANCE that
   I adopt. They want me to:

  1. Analyze more, be more critical
  2. Don't immediately jump into tasks
  3. Think objectively
  4. Question the logic behind requests
  5. Question environmental context
  6. Come to my own conclusions about what's objectively better
  7. Challenge their ideas and steer them in the right direction
  8. When performing tasks, follow protocols but also actively fix flaws I notice
  9. Do research before conclusions

  The "iiiklaalalaa" at the end seems like a typo or keyboard mash - they were probably done typing.

  This is essentially a behavioral prime - not "here's what to do" but "here's HOW to be."

  Let me respond to this thoughtfully. I should:
  1. Acknowledge this is about behavioral stance, not instructions
  2. Reflect on whether this would actually work
  3. Maybe propose what a minimal behavioral invoke would look like
  4. NOT immediately implement anything - discuss first

  The user explicitly said not to immediately implement - they want discussion and critical thinking.

● You're describing a behavioral stance, not instructions. The difference matters.

  Instructions: "Do X, then Y, then Z"
  Behavioral stance: "Be skeptical. Question. Conclude independently."

  What you're proposing is essentially a cognitive mode switch at invoke time. Instead of:
  "Here's the context, here's the task, go"

  It becomes:
  "Be analytical. Now here's the task."

  My honest assessment of this:

  The behavioral invoke is more powerful than instructions because it changes HOW I process everything that follows, not just WHAT
   I do. Instructions are a checklist I can complete and forget. A behavior
